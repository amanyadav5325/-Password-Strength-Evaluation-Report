🔍 Password Strength Analysis
✅ Factors That Make a Password Strong
Length ≥ 12 characters – Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack.

Character Diversity:

Uppercase letters (A–Z) – e.g., T, D, Q

Lowercase letters (a–z) – e.g., k, z, m

Numbers (0–9) – e.g., 3, 9, 2, 7

Special Characters (@, #, $, !, etc.)

Avoid dictionary words or real names

Avoid predictable patterns – such as 1234, qwerty, etc.
